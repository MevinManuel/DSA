# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice
This repository serves as a personal collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice problems. The solutions are primarily implemented in Python and JavaScript, with problems often sourced from the renowned "Cracking the Coding Interview" (CTCI) book.
<br>

# 📂 Repository Structure
The codes are organized by DSA topics.

# 🐍 Python Solutions
This directory contains DSA solutions written in Python. Each problem is typically placed within a folder corresponding to the CTCI chapter or a general DSA topic .

To run a Python solution:

Navigate to the specific file in your terminal:

```

cd python/chapter_01_arrays_strings/
```
Execute the script:

```
python is_unique.py
```
📜 JavaScript Solutions
This directory holds DSA solutions implemented in JavaScript. Similar to Python, files are organized by CTCI chapter or DSA category (e.g., chapter_02_linked_lists, trees_graphs).

To run a JavaScript solution (requires Node.js installed):

Navigate to the specific file in your terminal:
```

cd javascript/chapter_02_linked_lists/
```
Execute the script using Node.js:
```
node remove_dups.js
```
